\section{Introduction}

Due to limitations in acquisition time, injectable dose and scanner sensitivity,
acquired data in positron emission tomography (PET) suffer from high levels of
Poisson noise that is transfered into the reconstructed image necessitating
noise suppression during or post reconstruction.
One possible way of noise suppression is the maximum a posteriori approach
where a smoothing prior added next to the data fidelity term (the negative
Poisson loglikelihood) in the cost function optimized in iterative image 
reconstruction.
Unfortunately, many advanced smoothing priors such as e.g. Total Variation (TV) [XXX],
Generalized TV [XXX], Directional TV [XXX] or Parallel Level Sets [XXX] are non-smooth 
functions which permits the use of simple and efficient purely gradient-based
optimization algortihms.
Moreover, due to the large number of data bins in a (time-of-flight) sinogram
of modern PET scanners, the compution time for a single evaluation of the complete
forward (and adjoint) model is usually slow favoring optimiztion algorithms that
use only a subset of the data ine every update step like maximum expectation maximization
with ordered subsets (OSEM).

Recently, Chambolle et al. \cite{Chambolle2018} and  Ehrhardt et al. \cite{Ehrhardt2019} introduced 
the stochastic primal dual hybrid gradient (SPDHG) algorithm which is a convergent algorithms
to allows to solve the PET reconstruction problem inlcuding many non-smooth priors with
only a few iterations. 
Algorithm \ref{alg:spdhg} shows SPDHG using a typical PET forward model.
As seen in line 6 and 7, in every update only a forward and backprojection of subset
of the data is required.
Using two clinical FDG and Fluorbetapir data sets from the Siemens mMR, 
it was shown in \cite{Ehrhardt2019}, that approximately 10 iterations, meaning 10 complete 
forward and back projections of the data, are sufficient to reach reasonable convergence
for clinical purposes when using preconditioning and proper sampling of the subsets.

Without loss of generality, we focus in this work on the time-of-flight (TOF) PET reconstruction 
using TV regularization yielding the optimization problem
%
\begin{equation}
\argmin _{x\geq 0} \sum_j \underbrace{(Px)_j -  d_j \log \left( (Px)_ j + s_j \right)}_{D_j(x)} + \beta \, \|\nabla x\|_{1,2},
\end{equation}
where $x$ is the PET image to be reconstructed, $P$ is the TOF forward projector including the effects
of attenuation and normalization, $d$ are the acquired prompt TOF coincidences (the emission sinogram),
and $s$ are additive contaminations including random and scattered coincidences. $\nabla$ is the gradient
operator, and $\beta$ is a scalar controlling the level of regularization.

In the application of Algorithm~\ref{alg:spdhg}, we follow the approach if \cite{Ehrhardt2019}
by splitting the data into n non-overlapping subsets with the corresponding 
sequence of partial PET forwad operators denoted as $(P_i)_{i=1}^n$.
To simplify notation, we set $P_{n+1} = \nabla$ and choose the probabilities $p_1=\ldots=p_n = 1/(2n)$
and $p_{n+1} = 1/2$.
For $\rho<1$, we define preconditioned step sizes for the partial PET operators, for $i=1,\ldots,n$
\[ S_i = \text{diag}(\frac{\rho}{P_i 1} )\qquad  T_i = \text{diag}(\frac{\rho p_i}{P^T_i 1}) \]
and for the gradient opertator
\[ S_{n+1} = \frac{\rho}{\|\nabla\|} \qquad T_{n+1} = \frac{p_i\rho}{\|\nabla\|} \]  
As metioned in \cite{Ehrhardt2019}, if we set $T = \min_{i=1,\ldots,n+1} T_i$ pointwise,
SPDHG converges.
