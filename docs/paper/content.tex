\section{Introduction}

A major challenges of image reconstruction in positron emission tomography (PET)
is noise suppression since the acquired emission data suffer from high levels of Poisson
noise due to limitations in acquisition time, injectable dose and scanner sensitivity.
To limit the transfer of the data noise into the image during model-based iterative
reconstruction (MBIR), different strategies exist. 
One possibility is to add a ``smoothing'' prior to the data fidelity term in the cost
function that is being optimized.
In general, we can write the optimization problem for PET image reconstruction as
%
\begin{equation}
\argmin _{x\geq 0} \sum_{i=1}^{m} \underbrace{(Px + s)_i -  d_i \log \left( (Px + s)_i \right)}_{D_i(x)} + \, \beta R(Kx),
\label{eq:primal}
\end{equation}
%
where $x$ is the PET image to be reconstructed, $P$ is the (TOF) forward model including the effects
of attenuation and normalization and blurring, $d$ are the acquired prompt TOF coincidences 
(the emission sinogram), and $s$ are additive contaminations including random and 
scattered coincidences. 
$\sum_{i=1}^m D_i(x)$ is the negative Poisson log-likelihood, $i$ is the index of the data (TOF sinogram)bin and $m$ is the total number of data (TOF sinogram) bins.
$R(Kx)$ is the ``smoothing prior'' consisting of a generic linear operator $K$ that calculates 
local differences and a proper, convex, lower-semicontinous function $R$.
The level of regularization is controlled by the non-negative scalar factor $\beta$.
A specific example for $K$ would be the gradient operator $\nabla$, e.g. approximated by finite forward 
differences in the discretized setting.
Using the gradient operator for $K$ and the mixed L2-L1 norm for $R$ leads to the well-known 
Total Variation (TV) prior \cite{Rudin1992}.

Unfortunately, many advanced smoothing priors aiming for edge-preservation 
such as e.g. TV \cite{Rudin1992}, Total Generalized Variation (TGV) 
\cite{Bredies2010}, Joint T(G)V \cite{Rigie2015,Knoll2016}
Parallel Level Sets \cite{Ehrhardt2016a,Schramm2017} or directional Total Variation (DTV)
\cite{Ehrhardt2016} use non-smmoth functions for $R$ which permits the use of simple and efficient 
purely gradient-based optimization algorithms to solve \eqref{eq:primal}.

\subsection*{PDHG and SPDHG for PET reconstruction}

Using the fact that $D(x) = \sum_i D_i(x)$ and $R(x)$ are equal to their convex biconjugates 
$D^{**}(x) = \sup_y \langle Px + s, y \rangle - \sum_{i=1}^{m} D_i^*(y_i)$ 
and $R^{**}(x) = \sup_w \langle Kx, w \rangle - R^*(w)$, respectively, and that 
$(\beta R(x))^* = \beta R^*(w / \beta)$, we can rewrite \eqref{eq:primal} as the saddle point problem
%
\begin{equation}
\argmin _{x\geq 0} \, \sup_{y,w} \,  \langle Px + s, y \rangle + \langle Kx, w \rangle - \sum_{i=1}^{m} D_i^*(y_i) - \beta R^*(w/\beta) ,
\label{eq:saddle}
\end{equation}
%
introducing the dual variables $y$ and $w$ and the convex dual of the Poisson log-likelihood given by
%
\begin{equation}
D_i^*(y_i) =
\begin{cases}
-d_i + d_i \log \left( \frac{d_i}{1-y_i} \right) & \text{if } y_i < 1 \\
\infty & \text{else} \ .
\end{cases}
\end{equation}
%
Problem \eqref{eq:saddle}, can be solved using the generic primal-dual hybrid gradient (PDHG) 
algorithm by Chambolle and Pock \cite{Chambolle2011} even for non-smooth priors.
PDHG is in iterative algorithm that requires the evaluation of the complete forward and adjoint operator
in every update.
The usage of the original PDHG algorithm to solve \eqref{eq:saddle} for real-world state-of-the-art
TOF PET systems usually means extremly long computation times, because evaluation of $P$ (corrected TOF 
forward projection) and $P^T$ (corrected TOF back projection) 
for state-of-the-art TOF PET systems are usually slow and because several hundreds to thousand of updatesare needed to obtain reasonable convergence.

To overcome this limitatation, Chambolle et al. published a stochastic extension of PDHG called SPDHG 
for saddle point problems that are separable in the dual variable \cite{Chambolle2018} in 2018.
In contrast to PDHG, SPDHG has the advantage that the complete forward and adjoint operator is 
split into $n$ subsets and that in every update only a random subset of the forward
and adjoint operator chosen according to probability $p_k$ have to be evaluated.
In \cite{Ehrhardt2019}, Ehrhardt et al. applied SPDHG to 3D non-TOF PET reconstruction with TV-like
priors and could indeed show that around 10 complete projections and back projections are sufficient 
to obtain reasonable convergence using SPDHG with 252 subsets.
Moreover, the authors also demonstrated that preconditioning further accelerates convergence.
The resulting SPDHG algorithm to solve \eqref{eq:saddle} is summarized in Algorithm \ref{alg:spdhg},
where the proximal operator of the convex conjugate of the negative Poisson log-likehood $D_i^*$ 
can be calculated point-wise and is given by
%
\begin{equation}
\begin{split}
(\prox_{D_i^*}^{S}(y))_i &= \prox_{D_i^*}^{S}(y_i) \\ 
&= \frac{1}{2} \left(y_i + 1 - \sqrt{ (y_i-1)^2 + 4 S_i d_i} \right) \ .
\end{split}
\label{eq:proxD}
\end{equation} 
%
The proximal operator for $R^*$, obviously depends on choice of $R$ but can be also efficiently 
computed using point-wise operations for many popular choices of $R$.
As mentioned in \cite{Ehrhardt2019}, Algorithm \ref{alg:spdhg} converges if we use the preconditioned
step sizes
%
\[ S_k = \gamma \, \text{diag}(\frac{\rho}{P_k 1} )\qquad  T_k = \gamma^{-1} \text{diag}(\frac{\rho p_k}{P^T_k 1}) \ , \]
% 
and
%
\[ S_{n+1} = \gamma \, \frac{\rho}{\|K\|} \qquad T_{n+1} = \gamma^{-1} \frac{p_i\rho}{\|K\|} \ , \]
%
setting $T = \min_{k=1,\ldots,n+1} T_i$ pointwise, and choosing $\rho<1$ and $\gamma>0$.

\subsection*{Limitations of PDHG and SPDHG for PET reconstruction}

Whilst SPDHG is a big step forward for an efficient solution of \eqref{eq:saddle} using
in terms of computational speed, it also comes with two main limitations.
First of all, as discussed in Remark 2 of \cite{Ehrhardt2019}, 
a potential drawback of SPDHG is that it requires to keep at least one more complete 
(TOF) sinogram in memory (the dual variable $y$). 
Moreover, if the proposed preconditioning is used, a second complete (TOF) sinogram
(the sequence of step sizes $(S_k)_{k=1}^n$) needs to be stored in memory.
The latter is not a major problem for static single-bed non-TOF PET data, where sinogram sizes
are relatively small.
However, for simultaneous multi-bed, dynamic or TOF PET data, the size of the complete data sinograms
can be become problematic, especially when we would like to run Algorithm \ref{alg:spdhg} on
state-of-the-art GPUs with limited memory.
E.g., for a TOF PET scanner with 25\,cm axial FOV and a TOF resolution of ca. 400\,ps, 
a complete unmashed static TOF sinogram for one bed position 
has approximately $4.4\cdot10^9$ data bins, requiring ca. 17\,GB of memory in 32\,bit floating
point precision.
Note that with improved TOF resolution and increasing axial field of view (e.g. total body 
PET scanners), the memory required to store a complete TOF sinogram will substantially increase
in the future.

Second, PDHG and SPDHG only work with ``binned'' data.
In the case of TOF PET reconstruction that means that the acquired raw listmode data first needs to be
binned into TOF sinograms and that the forward and back projections need to be computed using
sinogram projectors.
For most acquisitions with modern TOF PET scanners, this is inefiicient both in terms of memory and
computational time since the TOF emission data is extremely sparse.
In contrast, storage and processing of the data in listmode format (event by event) is usually 
more efficient.

\subsection*{Sparsity of TOF PET data}

In contrast to non-TOF PET emission sinograms, TOF PET emission sinograms of most acquisitions
with state-of-the-art TOF PET scanners are extremely sparse.
This is because the every geometrical line of response (LOR) has to be subdivided into
several small TOF bins.
To achieve sufficient sampling of the TOF information, the number of TOF bins has to
inversely propotional to the TOF resolution of the scanner. 
Consequently, for a fixed number of acquired prompt coincidences, the sparsity of the
sinogram is proportional to the TOF resolution.

As an example, for a typical 80\,s-per-bed-position whole-body FDG scan with an injected dose 
of around 323\,MBq acquired 60\,min p.i. on a state-of-the-art TOF PET/CT scanner with
20\,cm axial FOV, more than 94\% of the data (TOF sinogram) bins are empty.
An example that demonstrates this extreme sparsity of TOF sinograms is shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:sparsity}.
For shorter frames, as present e.g. in the early phase of dynamic scans or when gating is used, 
the fraction of empty bins can even higher.
%And even for ``high count'' late static 20\,min FDG brain scans with an injected dose of 150\,MBq
%acquired 60\,min p.i., still around 70\% of the data bins are empty.

Note that we expect that the sparsity of the TOF emission data of future PET systems will increase 
faster than linear compared to the improvement of the TOF resolution.
This is because with better TOF resolution, every detected event carries more information such
that fewer detected events are needed to reconstruct images with the same variance \cite{Tomitani1981}.

\subsection*{Contributions and Aim}

To improve the efficiency of SPDHG in terms of memory and computation time when reconstructing 
sparse TOF PET data, we propose and analyze a listmode version of the SPDHG algorithm (LM-SPDHG) 
that allows event-by-event processing using dedicated listmode forward and back projectors.
We first of all derive LM-SPDHG from SPDHG and show that the convergence of LM-SPDHG is as 
fast as the convergence of SPDHG based on dedicated numeric examples.
Moreover, we analyze the requirements in terms of memory and computational time
for LM-SPDHG compared to SPDHG for typical scans acquired on state-of-the-art TOF scanners.


\section{Theory}

In the next subsection, we first of all show how to reduce the memory requirements
when reconstructing sparse TOF sinograms before deriving the complete LM-SPDHG algorithm.

\subsection*{Memory-efficient SPDHG for sparse TOF sinograms}

As shown in \cite{Schramm2021}, the memory requirements for SPDHG can substantially reduced by choosing
a better intialization of the dual variable $y$.

From Eq.~(\ref{eq:proxD}) we can observe that for data bins $i$ where $d_i = 0$ 
(empty TOF sinogram bins), $\prox_{D_i^*}(a_i) = 1$ for $a_i \geq 1$ and $\prox_{D_i^*}(a_i) = a_i$ 
otherwise. 
Moreover, we see that $ a_i = y_i + S_i (P_i x + s_i) \geq 1$ provided that $y_i \geq 1$ 
since all other quantities are non-negative. 
Consequently, if we initialize all bins of $y$ where the data $d$ equals zero with one, 
these bins of $y$ remain $1$ during all iterations. 
This in turn means that these bins do not contribute to the update of $\delta z$, $z$, $\bar{z}$, 
and $x$, since only the difference between
$y$ and $y^+$ is backprojected in line 8 of algorithm~\ref{alg:spdhg} and
do not have to be kept in memory during the iteration loop (lines 3 until 17). 
The only place where the empty data bins contribute is the initialization of $z$ and $\bar{z}$
in line 2.
However, this linear one time operation can be split into smaller chunks to also reduce
the required memory of this step.

At a first glance the initialization of $y$ proposed above seems very artificial.
But, if we construct a better initialization $y^0$ in a way such that it is the solution of our
saddle point problem \eqref{eq:saddle} for a fixed initial $x^0$, it has to satisfy
%
\begin{equation}
\langle P x^0, y^0 \rangle - D^*(y^0) = D(Px^0 + s) \ ,
\end{equation}
%
which is the case when
%
\begin{equation}
y^0 \in \partial D(Px + s) |_{x^0} \ .
\end{equation}
%
Since $D$ (the negative Poisson loglikelihood) is differentiable, this leads
to the condition
\begin{equation}
y^0 = 1 - \frac{d}{Px^0 + s} \ ,
\end{equation}
where the division is to be understood point-wise.
We see that under this condition, $y^0$ is indeed one in bins where $d$ is zero,
irrespective of the choice of $x^0$.
As argued above, this improved intialization of $y$ naturally reduces the 
memory requirements of SPDHG and also improves the speed of convergence in case a
``warm start'' for $x^0$ is chosen. 
The latter can be e.g. achieved by applying one iteration
and a reasonable amount of subsets of the EM-TV algorithm \cite{Sawatzky2008, Burger2008} 
which can be also implemented in a listmode way. 
Note that EM-TV in general seems to be an appealing algorithm to solve our optimization
problem \eqref{eq:problem} also for listmode data.
However, in contrast to SPDHG, EM-TV does not converge when using subsets, as will
be shown later.

%Use quick EM-TV (e.g. 1 iteration 28 susbets) as initializtion for $x$.
%Initialize $y$ (dual variable of data) as
%\begin{equation}
%y^0 = 1 - \frac{d}{Px^0 + s} \ .
%\end{equation}
%Note that this also means that the initial y is 1 in bins where we have
%no data such that we don't need to keep y in memory during the iterations.
%
%(optionally) intialize $w$ (dual of gradient) in subgradient of $R(Kx^0)$
