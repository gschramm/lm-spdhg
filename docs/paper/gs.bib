abstract = {The novel concept of total generalized variation of a function u is introduced, and some of its essential properties are proved. Differently from the bounded variation seminorm, the new concept involves higher-order derivatives of u. Numerical examples illustrate the high quality of this functional as a regularization term for mathematical imaging problems. In particular this functional selectively regularizes on different regularity levels and, as a side effect, does not lead to a staircasing effect. {\textcopyright} 2010 Society for Industrial and Applied Mathematics.},

The analysis is carried out for general convex-concave saddle point problems and problems that are either partially smooth / strongly convex or fully smooth / strongly convex. We perform the analysis for arbitrary samplings of dual variables, and we obtain known deterministic results as a special case. Several variants of our stochastic method significantly outperform the deterministic variant on a variety of imaging tasks.},

@article{Ehrhardt2019,
abstract = {Uncompressed clinical data from modern positron emission tomography (PET) scanners are very large, exceeding 350 million data points (projection bins). The last decades have seen tremendous advancements in mathematical imaging tools many of which lead to non-smooth (i.e. non-differentiable) optimization problems which are much harder to solve than smooth optimization problems. Most of these tools have not been translated to clinical PET data, as the state-of-the-art algorithms for non-smooth problems do not scale well to large data. In this work, inspired by big data machine learning applications, we use advanced randomized optimization algorithms to solve the PET reconstruction problem for a very large class of non-smooth priors which includes for example total variation, total generalized variation, directional total variation and various different physical constraints. The proposed algorithm randomly uses subsets of the data and only updates the variables associated with these. While this idea often leads to divergent algorithms, we show that the proposed algorithm does indeed converge for any proper subset selection. Numerically, we show on real PET data (FDG and florbetapir) from a Siemens Biograph mMR that about ten projections and backprojections are sufficient to solve the MAP optimisation problem related to many popular non-smooth priors; thus showing that the proposed algorithm is fast enough to bring these models into routine clinical practice.},

abstract = {We explore the use of the recently proposed 'total nuclear variation' (TVN) as a regularizer for reconstructing multi-channel, spectral CT images. This convex penalty is a natural extension of the total variation (TV) to vector-valued images and has the advantage of encouraging common edge locations and a shared gradient direction among image channels. We show how it can be incorporated into a general, data-constrained reconstruction framework and derive update equationsÂ based on the first-order, primal-dual algorithm of Chambolle and Pock. Early simulation studies based on the numerical XCAT phantom indicate that the inter-channel coupling introduced by the TVN leads to better preservation of image features at high levels of regularization, compared to independent, channel-by-channel TV reconstructions.},

@incollection{Burger2008,
abstract = {The present volume collects the lecture notes of courses given at the CIME Summer School in Cetraro in September 2008. The school appeared to be a highly successful event with around 50 participants from all over the world, enjoying both the scientific content of the courses and the atmosphere and opportunities for discussions among participants and with the speakers. Mathematical imaging and inverse problems are two of the fastest growing disciplines in applied and interdisciplinary mathematics, with a strong overlap since many image analysis and reconstruction problems are effectively formulated as inverse problems. A key issue in such problems is to preserve and analyze edges or shapes in the image. Those are taken care by the methods covered in the summer school, which had the particular aim of providing a unified picture to methods of image reconstruction and analysis, on the one hand, and techniques for shape reconstruction and analysis, on the other hand. The key steps connecting those are methods based on level set representations and geometric partial differential equations, which effectively operate on the level sets (respectively, discontinuity set) of an image as well as on a single shape. The subject of lectures were chosen to cover these aspects and provide an outlook to other relevant topics.},
