In this work, we propose and analyze a listmode (LM) version of the stochastic primal-dual hybrid 
gradient (SPDHG) algorithm for image reconstruction of sparse data following a Poisson distribution 
using subsets and non-smooth priors. 
Since data from state-of-the-art time of flight (TOF) PET scanners are huge but at the same time
extremely sparse, listmode based algorithms, as the proposed LM-SDPHG algorithm,  
substantially reduces both memory requirements and computation time. 
Based on realistic simulations in 2D and 3D, we show that the speed of convergence of LM-SPDHG 
is the same as the one of the original SPDHG operating on binned data (sinograms).
For a state-of-the-art TOF PET system with 400\,ps TOF resolution and 25\,cm axial FOV,
LM SPDHG reduces the required memory from approximately 56\,GB to
0.7\,GB for a short dynamic frame with 1e7 prompt coincidences and to 12.4\,GB for a long 
static acquisition with 5e8 prompt coincidences.
In contrast to SPDHG, the reduced memory requirements of LM-SPDHG consequently enables a pure GPU implementation 
using state-of-the-art GPUs which will accelerate reconstruction times even further.
